1. Write a program which accept N numbers from user and store it into List. Return addition of all
  prime numbers from that List. Main python file accepts N numbers from user and pass each
  number to ChkPrime() function which is part of our user defined module named as
  MarvellousNum. Name of the function from main python file should be ListPrime().<br/>
