  contains one list of numbers. List contains the numbers which are accepted from user. Filter
  should filter out all such numbers which greater than or equal to 70 and less than or equal to

1. Write a program which contains filter(), map() and reduce() in it. Python application which
  contains one list of numbers. List contains the numbers which are accepted from user. Filter
  should filter out all such numbers which are even. Map function will calculate its square.
  Reduce will return addition of all that numbers.<br/>
  Input List = [5, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 1, 2, 8, 10]<br/>
  List after filter = [2, 4, 4, 2, 8, 10]<br/>
  List after map = [4, 16, 16, 4, 64, 100]<br/>

1. Write a program which contains filter(), map() and reduce() in it. Python application which
  contains one list of numbers. List contains the numbers which are accepted from user. Filter
  should filter out all prime numbers. Map function will multiply each number by 2. Reduce will
  return Maximum number from that numbers. (You can also use normal functions instead of
  lambda functions).<br/>
  Input List = [2, 70 , 11, 10, 17, 23, 31, 77]<br/>
  List after filter = [2, 11, 17, 23, 31]<br/>
  List after map = [4, 22, 34, 46, 62]<br/>
  Output of reduce = 62 <br/><br/>
